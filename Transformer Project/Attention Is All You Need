Project Title: Transformer Architecture – An Educational Reimplementation of Attention Is All You Need

- Executive Summary
This repository presents a didactic and research-oriented reimplementation of the Transformer model introduced in the influential publication “Attention Is All You Need” by Vaswani et al. (2017). The Transformer architecture represents a significant departure from prior sequence modeling approaches that relied on recurrence or convolution. By introducing self-attention mechanisms as the sole means of encoding sequential dependencies, the model enables increased parallelism, improved long-range context modeling, and architectural scalability.
This project is intended as an in-depth study and pedagogical reconstruction of the Transformer architecture, developed from first principles using [PyTorch/TensorFlow/NumPy], with an emphasis on transparency and conceptual clarity.

- Core Architectural Components
1. Scaled Dot-Product Attention
A mechanism that computes the alignment between queries, keys, and values in a computationally efficient manner. Scaling by the square root of the key dimension addresses issues of vanishing gradients in high-dimensional spaces.
2. Multi-Head Attention
An ensemble of attention operations running in parallel, allowing the model to capture relationships across multiple representational subspaces. Outputs from all heads are concatenated and linearly transformed.
3. Positional Encoding
To introduce order into the otherwise permutation-invariant attention mechanism, sinusoidal or learned positional embeddings are added to token representations. These encodings allow the model to reason about token position without recurrence.
4. Encoder–Decoder Structure
•	The encoder is composed of a stack of identical layers, each containing a self-attention mechanism and a feed-forward sublayer.
•	The decoder includes a similar stack, augmented with masked self-attention and encoder-decoder cross-attention layers to facilitate autoregressive sequence generation.
5. Feedforward Network & Residual Layers
Each sublayer in the architecture includes a two-layer feedforward neural network and is wrapped with residual connections and layer normalization to promote stable learning dynamics.

1. Supervised Learning
Definition:
Supervised learning involves training models on labeled datasets, where each input sample is paired with a corresponding output (label). The model learns a function to predict outputs for new, unseen data.
Key Algorithms:
•	Linear & Logistic Regression: Classical statistical methods for regression and binary classification tasks, respectively.
•	Support Vector Machines (SVM): Effective for both linear and non-linear classification via kernel tricks, maximizing margin separation between classes.
•	Decision Trees & Random Forests: Tree-based models that split data based on feature thresholds; Random Forests aggregate multiple trees to reduce variance and overfitting.
•	Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): Ensemble methods (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) that build additive models sequentially to optimize predictive performance.
•	Neural Networks (MLP, CNN, RNN): Flexible models that approximate complex functions; CNNs excel at spatial data (images), RNNs and variants (LSTM, GRU) handle sequences and time series.
Optimization Techniques:
•	Gradient descent variants (batch, stochastic, mini-batch) iteratively minimize loss functions.
•	Advanced optimizers like Adam combine momentum and adaptive learning rates for faster, stable convergence.
•	Regularization techniques (L1, L2, dropout) prevent overfitting by constraining model complexity.

2. Unsupervised Learning
Definition:
Unsupervised learning uncovers hidden patterns or structures in data without labeled responses.
Key Algorithms:
•	Clustering: Methods such as k-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN group similar data points based on distance or density metrics.
•	Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE reduce feature space dimensionality while preserving meaningful variance or neighborhood structure.
•	Anomaly Detection: Methods like Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM identify outliers or rare events in datasets.
•	Association Rule Learning: Algorithms like Apriori discover co-occurrence relationships, often used in market basket analysis.

3. Semi-Supervised Learning
Definition:
Semi-supervised learning leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to improve learning efficiency when labeled data is scarce.
Techniques:
•	Self-training: Models iteratively label unlabeled data and retrain.
•	Graph-based Methods: Exploit data relationships represented as graphs to propagate label information.
•	Generative Models: Such as semi-supervised GANs, generate plausible data augmentations.

4. Reinforcement Learning (RL)
Definition:
RL trains agents to make sequences of decisions by interacting with an environment, maximizing cumulative rewards.
Key Methods:
•	Value-Based: e.g., Q-Learning, where a value function estimates expected rewards of actions.
•	Policy-Based: Directly optimize the policy with methods like REINFORCE.
•	Actor-Critic: Hybrid approaches (e.g., A2C, PPO) combine value estimation and policy optimization for stability and efficiency.

5. Self-Supervised Learning
Definition:
A form of unsupervised learning where the model learns useful representations by solving proxy tasks derived from the data itself.
Applications:
•	Language models (e.g., BERT, GPT) predict masked words or next tokens.
•	Computer vision models predict image rotations, missing patches, or contrastive learning to distinguish samples.

6. Deep Learning Architectures
•	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Utilize convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies from images or structured grids.
•	Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), LSTM, GRU: Designed to capture temporal dependencies in sequences like text or speech.
•	Transformers: Leverage attention mechanisms for parallel sequence processing, revolutionizing NLP and now expanding to vision and other domains.
•	Generative Models: GANs and VAEs learn to generate realistic synthetic data, used in image synthesis, data augmentation, and anomaly detection.

7. Ensemble Learning
Combines multiple base models to improve robustness and accuracy.
•	Bagging: Averages predictions over many independently trained models (e.g., Random Forest).
•	Boosting: Sequentially trains models to correct errors of predecessors, improving overall accuracy (e.g., XGBoost).
•	Stacking: Learns to combine predictions from diverse models through meta-learners.

These models explicitly handle uncertainty and incorporate prior knowledge.
•	Bayesian Networks: Graphical models encoding probabilistic relationships between variables.
•	Gaussian Processes: Non-parametric models for regression with uncertainty estimation.
•	Hidden Markov Models (HMM): Statistical models for sequential data with hidden states.
